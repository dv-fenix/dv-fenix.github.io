I also actively worked on the development of multimodal autoregressive transformers and diffusion models for the purposes of text guided image generation.\nPreviously, I spent time as a Mitacs Globalink Research Intern at the University of British Columbia (Summer 2021) where I led a collaborative effort to develop efficient but accurate language models for software engineering tasks. I have also worked as a Research and Development Intern at Pando Labs (Fall 2020). We developed novel deep reinforcement learning solutions for operations research problems in the supply chain industry.\nAt IIT Roorkee, I was a core member of a Deep Learning research centric reading group named the Vision and Language Group, and the IEEE Student Chapter, IIT Roorkee.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/author/divyam-goel/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/divyam-goel/","section":"authors","summary":"Hi!
